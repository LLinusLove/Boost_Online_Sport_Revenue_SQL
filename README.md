# Boost_Online_Sport_Revenue_SQL
In this notebook, I will apply my SQL knowledge to analyse product data for an online sports retailer. 

Working with numeric, string, and timestamp data on pricing and revenue, ratings, reviews, descriptions, and website traffic is part of this project. 

Aggregation, cleaning, labelling, Common Table Expressions, and correlation will be used to generate recommendations on how the company can maximise revenue!
